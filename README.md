# Multi User ToDo App
# Overview:
The Multi-User To-Do App is a web-based application built with Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and SQLite. 
This project allows multiple users to create and manage their personal to-do lists within separate accounts. 
Each user can log in to their account, create new to-do tasks, update existing ones, delete tasks, and view all their to-dos.
The to-do contains a title, a status such as pending or completed, a priority level between 1 and 10, and the date of creation.
The app leverages Django's powerful authentication system to ensure secure access, and the admin has the ability to filter tasks by user in the admin panel.
